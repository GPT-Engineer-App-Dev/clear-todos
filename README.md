# clear-todos

Implement an Othello game with the following core functionality:

- An 8x8 game board rendered with Chakra UI components 
- Game pieces are black and white discs
- Players take turns placing their color disc on the board
- A disc played must capture at least one of the opponent's discs
- Captured discs are flipped to the capturing player's color
- Game ends when the board is full or neither player can capture any more discs
- The player with the most discs on the board at the end wins
- Display the current player's turn
- Highlight valid moves on the board on hover

Use state to track the 8x8 board, current player's turn, and if the game is over.
